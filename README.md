# Game Rule
The game starts with all the cards face down.Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If the following one flipped does not match the first one, it will be flipped over again with card back. If two flipped cards matches, they remain showing card front until game over or user clicked replay. Players win when they find all pairs.

# Game Logic:

- Set board to a 4*4 grid with 16 cards, 8 different pictures.
- When game starts, all the cards should be faced down (showing card back).
- Player flip over a card by clicking on it, showing card front picture. Start to count moves, and pairs found.
- Player flip over another card by clicking on it,
- If the second card is the same as the first one, two flipped matching cards remain face up.
Otherwise two cards flipped will filp over again back to card back.
- Game ends until player find all matching cards.
- Replay: shuffle cards, intialize board, update app state values.
